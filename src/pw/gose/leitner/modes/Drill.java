 *
 *
 * Assignment Description:
 *
 * â€¢ Drill: Under this method, the flashcards of a given box are copied into a
 * separate pool. The application randomly picks one flashcard from that pool.
 * If the user knows the answer, the card is removed from the pool. If the user
 * does not know the answer the card remains in the pool. Drill ends when the
 * pool is empty. When users end the drill session, the pool can be discarded.
 * During a drill session the Leitner boxes remain unchanged.
