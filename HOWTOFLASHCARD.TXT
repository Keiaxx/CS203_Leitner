Flashcards are imported and loaded based on a textfile format.

Each .txt should contain the following syntax:

-----------Start Text File-----------
question
answer

question2
answer2

question3
answer3
----------End Text File--------------

If you would like images in the question of the FlashCard, an image file
must be placed with the program itself (Jar or Project Directory) and denoted
with an img: prefix

image.png is located in the project directory of the current IDE, or in the same
folder as the running JAR.

------------Start Text File---------------
question

img:imagepng
answer to the image

-------------End Text File---------------
